Developing a React app can be very productive and fun, but if you are used to working with Vue as I do, there are some features that I miss a lot. One of those features is watchers. In this blog post, we will try to find out how to improve the current React API and create a custom hook to help us "watch" for state changes.

## What are watchers in React?

Before we try to understand what are watchers specific in React we have to understand what are watchers at all. Watchers are simple functions that listen for changes on one or more pieces of state. Watchers are very helpful and usually used when there is a requirement to interact with a component that lives outside the React world.

In the next example, we will build a search component and fetch data from our backend based on the input value.

## Using `useEffect` to watch for value changes

The best start is to use the `useEffect` hook, it should help us listen for changes in the input value and trigger a request to the backend based on it. Let's see how it goes:

```
First code part
```

This code should do the work, but there are two issues with the current implementation:
1. It fetches the data on the first render of the component (This is how `useEffect` works).
2. It fetches the data on each keystroke of the user (multiple times for no reason).

Let's try to resolve those issues.

## Using `useRef` to avoid first render fetching

To avoid triggering fetch on the first component render, we can use a flag that will determine if the current function call is the first one or not. To do so, we will use the `useRef` hook. Let's see an example:

```
code
```

Now, we skip calling our fetch mechanism in the first component render and use it only when the value of the input changed.

We already have a good "watcher". In the next step, we will take this implementation and wrap it to create a custom hook.

## Create a custom hook - `useWatch`

To make it even easier to use and reusable throughout the app, we will create a custom hook that will hold our "watching" mechanism.

```
code
```

This encapsulation makes our code clearer and easier to read. Here, again the `SearchBox` using the new hook we created:

```
code
```

In the next step, we will try to solve the second issue, when the fetching mechanism triggers every keystroke.

## Create a custom hook - `useDebouncedWatch`

One solution for the second issue could be to delay the fetching mechanism until the user stops typing and then, and only then, trigger the function that fetches the data from the backend.

```
code
```

This implementation will wait 1000 milliseconds and only then it will call the callback function (which will fetch data from the backend in our case). But if the value changes again before those 1000 milliseconds, the previous timer will be cleared and a new timer will start to count. This loop will go on and on until the user stops typing. Here is the final code from our `SearchBox` component that uses the new custom hook:

```
code
```

## Conclusion

As we can see, "watchers" exist in the React world. We just had to peel the shell and expose them out. It takes only a few steps to include this elegant API from Vue into React world.
